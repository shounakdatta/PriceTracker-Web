Welcome to Realitics. An universal price tracking web platform. This repo is the React frontend for an app that handles price fetching for products on online stores such as Amazon and Walmart. Geared for consumers, this app allows users to identify when the product is actually on sale, not when the seller tells you it is :wink:.

## Getting started

1. Fork this repo.
2. `cd PriceTracker-Web`
3. `yarn` or `npm i`
4. `yarn start` or `npm run start`
5. Go to http://localhost:3000
